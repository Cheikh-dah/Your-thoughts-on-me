# Your Thoughts on Me

This is a web app I made where people can rate me on different personality traits. It's pretty simple - you just use sliders to rate me and then you can see what everyone else thinks too.

You can try it here: **[https://your-thinks-on-chd.vercel.app/](https://your-thinks-on-chd.vercel.app/)**

## What it does

People can vote on 4 things about me:
- Humble or narcissistic
- Considerate or bully
- Kind or bad
- Smart or stupid

After you vote, you see your ratings and also the average of what everyone else voted. It's in Arabic and works on phones too.

## How to run it

I used React and Vite to build this. Here's how to run it on your computer:

1. Download the code (clone the repo)
2. Run `npm install` to install everything
3. You need to set up Firebase - create a project and put your config in `src/firebase.js`
4. Run `npm run dev` to start it
5. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

To build it for production, run `npm run build`.

## What I used

- React - for the UI
- Vite - to build and run it
- Firebase - to save the votes
- React Router - for the pages
- Vercel - to host it online

## Notes

This is my personal project. I made it to see what people think about me. The votes are anonymous and only the averages are shown.

If you want to help or have suggestions, feel free to let me know!
